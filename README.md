# ESC_Frame
A combined frame and 4in1 brushless ESC running BLHeli_s with 16mm hole spacing.

Derived from the excelent [tinyPEPPER](http://fishpepper.de/projects/tinypepper/) project by http://fishpepper.de As such I have also used the fishpepper KiCad resources - [kicad_misc](https://github.com/fishpepper/kicad_misc) 

Until I write a proper build guide the [tinyPEPPER v0.5](http://fishpepper.de/2017/03/23/tinypepper-esc-how-to-build-your-own-v0-5/) build guide will be the best reference.

Key features:
- Frame integrated ESC reduces stack height
- 83mm motor-to-motor frame size suits BR1103b motors
- 16x16mm hole-to-hole spacing for FC
- BLHeli_S with DSHOT300
- 1S only
